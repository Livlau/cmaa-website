          <p class="text-start">Classes meet from September through June. Enrollment is open and fluctuates: in class term 2014-2015 117 students were enrolled. Classes produce significant levels of improvement in English language proficiency as measured by the BEST Plus (a nationally-recognized English language proficiency exam); at last report, 70% of the 66 students tested showed an educational gain.
